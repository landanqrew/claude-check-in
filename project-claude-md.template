# [Project Name]

## Overview

Brief description of the project — what it does, who it's for.

**Tech stack:** [e.g., Go + PostgreSQL, Next.js + TypeScript, Python + FastAPI]

---

## Current Priorities

<!-- This is what the check-in bot reads to decide what to work on next. -->
<!-- Keep it ordered — #1 is what gets picked up first. -->

1. [First priority — be specific, e.g., "Add user authentication with JWT tokens"]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]

---

## Architecture Notes

<!-- Key structural decisions the bot should know about. -->

- [e.g., "API routes are in src/routes/, each file handles one resource"]
- [e.g., "Database migrations live in db/migrations/ using golang-migrate"]
- [e.g., "Frontend state is managed with Zustand, not Redux"]

---

## Commands

**Test:**
```bash
# e.g., go test ./..., npm test, pytest
```

**Build:**
```bash
# e.g., go build ./cmd/server, npm run build
```

**Lint:**
```bash
# e.g., golangci-lint run, npm run lint
```

---

## Constraints

<!-- Things the bot should NOT do. -->

- [e.g., "Do not modify the database schema without a migration"]
- [e.g., "Do not add new npm dependencies without discussion"]
- [e.g., "Keep all API responses under the existing envelope format"]
